# About
Application Security requirements generator, based on ASVS, OWASP Testing guide and some experience :)

![App homescreen](/images/requirements.png?raw=true "App homescreen")

## More about the problem
Many of you have seen a huge set of requirements from OWASP and met developers faces with many words to your side about such a big document.
If not - you may find it [here](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_4.0-en.pdf) and try to share it to devs without prepairing them :)

## What we did
- Split ASVS requirements by functionality
- Have added a function to mark some requirements as important (so your devs can start from them for example)
- Mapped requirements to tests
- Shared it for you in this repository and [on our subdomain](https://requirements.whitespots.io/en)

## Now you can
- Use our free tool online [here](https://requirements.whitespots.io/en)
- Use our free tool in your infrastructure (see instructions below)

And have a useful set of **important** and **relevant** requirements:

```

# Deploy
## Server
```bash
export BASE_URL=http://text_your_hostname(domain)_here
docker-compose up -d --build
docker-compose run back migrate
docker-compose run back collectstatic
docker-compose run back loaddata
docker-compose exec back ./manage.py create_super_user --username admin --password PASSWORD
docker-compose up
open https://text_your_hostname(domain)/admin/  # to login and set your company name
```

## Local
### Back
- create virtualenv & install requirements
```bash
cd back
pyenv virtualenv 3.9.0 srg_back
pyenv activate srg_back
pip install poetry
poetry install
```
- set environments
```bash
export DEBUG=on
export ALLOWED_HOSTS=*
export BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
export REDIS_DSN=redis://localhost:6379/0
export DB_USER=user
export DB_PASS=pass
export DB_HOST=localhost
export DB_NAME=srg
```
- call `pre-commit install` at command line
- create DB in pg market
- add envs from [.env.dev](back/.env.dev)
- apply DB migrations `./manage.py migrate`
- create super user `./manage.py create_super_user`
- run localserver `./manage.py runserver`
- open [admin panel](http://localhost:8000/admin/) and login as admin:admin
- call `make pre-commit` before making a commit

### Front
```bash
cd front
npm install
npm run serve
open http://localhost:8080
npm run build
```
